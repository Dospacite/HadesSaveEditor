HadesSaveEditor was made as a personal project, for personal save editing in mind. It never crossed my mind that it would be used by so many people. I unfortunately cannot keep up with the updates anymore and depend on contributors. If you want to contribute, feel free.

Project is heavily inspired by hades_save_editor by @zsennenga. This was made by reversing the python code and its dependencies and implementing them in browser-compatible javascript so it can run in the browser by itself. I also found a version of LZ4 that worked correctly.

Any part of this project might be outdated, any passionate contributors interesting in taking over the project can reach me out at ege@rousoftware.com.
